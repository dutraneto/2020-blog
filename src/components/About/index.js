      <S.AboutDescription>
        I am Jos√© Dutra. I worked at The Brazilian Army Forces as a Sergeant for
        the past 16 years. However, my passion for programming has got me
        following a new career change as a Frontend Developer. My interest in
        programming languages, such as JavaScript, drove me to specializing
        currently in Frontend Development.

        As a developer, I've been working with basic web technologies (HTML,
        CSS, and Javascript) and sophisticated frameworks and libraries like
        jQuery, React, Sass, Bootstrap in projects of different sizes. I also
        have experience building backend applications using Node.js with
        Express.js and MongoDB and as well as Python with Django.
