      <S.AboutDescription>
        I am Jos√© Dutra. I worked at The Brazilian Army Forces as a Sergeant for
        the past 16 years. However, my passion for programming has got me
        following a new career change as a Frontend Developer. My interest in
        programming languages, such as JavaScript, drove me to specializing
        currently in Frontend Development.
